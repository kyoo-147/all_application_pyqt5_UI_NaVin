# Object-Detection-Application
Object Detection App using Python, OpenCV and PYQT5

Did this project on my placement.

Took ages , was very new to me, and a big step up from my other projects.

It's not perfect but what I learnt doing it was what is important.

It sometimes crashes when you hit the start button but it normally runs ok.
